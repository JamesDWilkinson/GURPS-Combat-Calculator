# GURPS-Combat-Calculator
 python scripts for the purposes of simulating and analyzing GURPS combat mechanics. I plan to take a functional approach to this calculator to practice my functional programming in python. I may or may not break down and cry and write for loops instead. Either way, I'll write it all down in a Jupyter notebook to document the journey.
