    "# Purpose of This Project\n",
    "This project will contain python scripts for the purposes of simulating and analyzing GURPS 4e combat mechanics. I plan to take a functional approach to this calculator to practice my functional programming in python. I may or may not break down and cry and write for loops instead. I expect to embarrassingly mess up the whole adhering to the functional paradigm entirely and have to revisit a lot of my functions. Either way, I'll write it all down in a Jupyter notebook to document the journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I'll start by finding a function that can roll dice. GURPS 4e combat is highly reliant on dice rolls, so—while we can analyze the rolls mathematically—the ability to run simulations should be a lot more practical in situations where we are learning the mathematics or want to see how it might feel to a player in our game.\n",

    "GURPS 4e heavily utilizes the roll of three six sided dice (3d6), abbreviated in the context of the system simply to 3d. Our 3d rolls will have a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 18, as shown above, but the distribution won't be completely linear. We might repackage the `rd.randint()` function into another function. On that note, regarding the functional approach I'd like to take, I am not going to remake `rd.randint()` from scratch to make it more \"functional\". This approach practice will only apply to user-defined functions for the time being.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we should aim to make a couple of functions: one to roll any number of dice and output a number, particularly rolls of 3d, and one that calculates the probability of getting any given number from a roll.\n",
