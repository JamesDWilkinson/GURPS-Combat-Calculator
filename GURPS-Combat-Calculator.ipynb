    "# Purpose of This Project\n",
    "This project will contain python scripts for the purposes of simulating and analyzing GURPS 4e combat mechanics. I plan to take a functional approach to this calculator to practice my functional programming in python. I may or may not break down and cry and write for loops instead. I expect to embarrassingly mess up the whole adhering to the functional paradigm entirely and have to revisit a lot of my functions. Either way, I'll write it all down in a Jupyter notebook to document the journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I'll start by finding a function that can roll dice. GURPS 4e combat is highly reliant on dice rolls, so—while we can analyze the rolls mathematically—the ability to run simulations should be a lot more practical in situations where we are learning the mathematics or want to see how it might feel to a player in our game.\n",

Our 3d rolls will have a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 18, as shown above, but the distribution won't be completely linear. We might repackage the `rd.randint()` function into another function. On that note, regarding the functional approach I'd like to take, I am not going to remake `rd.randint()` from scratch to make it more \"functional\". This approach practice will only apply to user-defined functions for the time being.\n",

On top of that, there are strategies like striking the head that—depending on the dice—could result in incapacitation and thus very high DPS due to low defense chance, attacking with multiple people per round on one target which can affect defense chance, and even non-direct damage strategies like trying to push a target off of a cliff. Furthermore, a lot of the attributes invovled in these calculations are often weighted by a point-buy system. Again, calculating DPS can be a bit complicated.\n",

    "Now that we have something that can roll dice and tell us the probability of getting a given total—a set of faces added together—we can hopefully make good use of it by giving context to the damage rolls in GURPS, and use it to measure the trade-offs between various combat options in the system.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before the coding though, let's see if we can intuit the answer. Assuming just the damage roll, the DPS is 3.5. If we add in a defense roll, we realize that we have the probability for any given total, but what we actually want is the probability of getting 9 or lower. Let's code that really quick."

    "Another issue to worry about in the future has to do with index 18. It is a given that a total of 18 is 100%, but this is notable for a special reason, because an 18 is a \"critical fail\" in GURPS regardless of almost any other factors; combined with a critical fail table, this makes a roll of 18 a can of worms for calculating DPS. There are similar issues like 3 and 4 being a \"critical success\", accompanied by at least two tables; additionally, 17 is an automatic fail, and there are conditions that widen the critical success range. We'll cross that bridge when we get there."
