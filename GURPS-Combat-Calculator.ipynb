    "# Purpose of This Project\n",
    "This project will contain python scripts for the purposes of simulating and analyzing GURPS 4e combat mechanics. I plan to take a functional approach to this calculator to practice my functional programming in python. I may or may not break down and cry and write for loops instead. I expect to embarrassingly mess up the whole adhering to the functional paradigm entirely and have to revisit a lot of my functions. Either way, I'll write it all down in a Jupyter notebook to document the journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I'll start by finding a function that can roll dice. GURPS 4e combat is highly reliant on dice rolls, so—while we can analyze the rolls mathematically—the ability to run simulations should be a lot more practical in situations where we are learning the mathematics or want to see how it might feel to a player in our game.\n",

Our 3d rolls will have a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 18, as shown above, but the distribution won't be completely linear. We might repackage the `rd.randint()` function into another function. On that note, regarding the functional approach I'd like to take, I am not going to remake `rd.randint()` from scratch to make it more \"functional\". This approach practice will only apply to user-defined functions for the time being.\n",

On top of that, there are strategies like striking the head that—depending on the dice—could result in incapacitation and thus very high DPS due to low defense chance, attacking with multiple people per round on one target which can affect defense chance, and even non-direct damage strategies like trying to push a target off of a cliff.

We learned that about half of the turns taken will result in nothing happening, and that it will take an average of 5 rounds, though in the future we might want to run simulations to see if the average is a useful value or if a large percentage of simulations take 4 or 6 rounds or some result that splits the average even more egregiously; in other words \"how swingy is our combat scenario\".\n",
