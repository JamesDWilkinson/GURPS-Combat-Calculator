    "# Purpose of This Project\n",
    "This project will contain python scripts for the purposes of simulating and analyzing GURPS 4e combat mechanics. I plan to take a functional approach to this calculator to practice my functional programming in python. I may or may not break down and cry and write for loops instead. I expect to embarrassingly mess up the whole adhering to the functional paradigm entirely and have to revisit a lot of my functions. Either way, I'll write it all down in a Jupyter notebook to document the journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I'll start by finding a function that can roll dice. GURPS 4e combat is highly reliant on dice rolls, so—while we can analyze the rolls mathematically—the ability to run simulations should be a lot more practical in situations where we are learning the mathematics or want to see how it might feel to a player in our game.\n",

Our 3d rolls will have a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 18, as shown above, but the distribution won't be completely linear. We might repackage the `rd.randint()` function into another function. On that note, regarding the functional approach I'd like to take, I am not going to remake `rd.randint()` from scratch to make it more \"functional\". This approach practice will only apply to user-defined functions for the time being.\n",

On top of that, there are strategies like striking the head that—depending on the dice—could result in incapacitation and thus very high DPS due to low defense chance, attacking with multiple people per round on one target which can affect defense chance, and even non-direct damage strategies like trying to push a target off of a cliff.

    "For now, let's assume a weird situation where the attack and defense skill are both 3. There is no deceptive attack even possible. Now attack and defense skill 5. Now your probability to hit isn't att 5 vs def 5 or att 3 vs def 4 like it was before. Now we can't simply have the chance of getting 5 or lower vs not-getting 5 or lower, because we have distinct situations now depending on what is actually rolled. if a 5 or 4 is rolled, then `dps(5, 5)` covers the calculation since the `5` for the attack skill represents getting a 5 or lower, but once we roll a 3, then suddenly we need the probability of `dps(3, 4)`, and for calculating DPS, this needs to be encapsulated in one calculation.\n",

    "The probability of landing a hit with a skill of 15 vs a defense skill of 9 is usually 59.6%, but it will be higher with our homebrew rule, so we know that our calculation should involve making this probability even bigger. Let's go through the list of possible results, ignoring criticals. First though, we'll print out our probabilities of getting any individual result again with our old friend `prob_nds()` as well as the probabilities of getting a certain roll or lower:"

GMs might ask the players their intention for an encounter: if they say combat, then they are more potent but more vulnerable. If they say their intentions are objective-based, then they are more survivable but can't dispatch enemies as easily. It could also be and probably should be GM fiat, where the GM decides whether or not a given encounter is combat or objective based.\n",

    "Our first issue is that we can easily try to index a list outside of its range if we make a general function. Another issue is our criticals, but we can kill two birds with one stone here. We fix it so that anything that would index out of the range of 5-16 is an automatic success or failure and doesn't even interact with our function (later we can factor in the specifics of critical tables, we'll wait until we fix a few other issues, particularly the entanglement of trade-offs between hit chance, amounts of hits, hit location, and hit damage that will come up later).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing we'll consider is that an attack at skill 18 or higher should automatically apply levels of deceptive attack, since your effective attack skill can only really be, at most, 16 since a roll of 17 is an automatic failure and 18 is a critical failure.\n",
    "\n",

At the end of this, we want to be able to answer questions like \"How likely am I to charm a monster in combat after hitting a successful Mind Sliver\". The answer involves calculating advantage with a modifier from a d4, so not something that is easy to do in one's head. This way, we can decide if it is more worth it to spend many spell slots on failed charm attempts or to wait for a successful Mind Sliver, or if we should just not be charming in combat unless we can negate the advantage on the save? Should we Mind Sliver even if we can negate advantage for a save? This will also help develop tools for analytical game design.\n",

For Advantage, we want to calculate the probality when rolling 2d20 to get a certain number or higher on either dice, rather than totalling them together. For Disadvantage we want to calculate the probability when rolling 2d20 to get a certain number or higher, but only on the dice with a lower number.\n",

    "We'll want to use techniques we've already used to list the 400 permutations of 2d20, and then we can use code to discriminate between the two values. Previously, we used a sum function to total each set of dice rolls, and then we use `Series.value_counts()` and math to give us probabilities; this time we'll use a max function for Advantage and a min function for Disadvantage to simply return the appropriate value, and then we'll use the same technique to count up the options. It sounds like we'll want to recycle our `prob_nds()` function. From a functional standpoint, it almost seems like the function we want to have takes a function in its arguments for the comprehension that gets turned into a Series.\n",
